Subject: API key returns 401 Unauthorized — please verify activation/scope

Hello Trading 212 support team,

My API key is returning a 401 Unauthorized when I call the account endpoint. Please can you check whether the key is active and allowed for API calls?

Details:
- Account / email: <your account email or ID>
- Key ID: 44068546ZoNeiGnSAeOdKazdiHxDLnbgIkVZz
- Environment tested: demo (also tested live)
- Test executed (no secret included):
  curl -i -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(key:secret)>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://demo.trading212.com/api/v0/equity/account/cash"
- Response observed:
  - HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  - Date: Sun, 28 Dec 2025 21:20:45 GMT

Actions I’ve taken:
- Confirmed key/secret were copied correctly and tested both demo and live endpoints
- Rotated previously exposed credentials and removed local copies

Questions:
1. Is the key active for the demo and/or live endpoint?
2. Are there any scopes, IP allowlists, or activation steps required before the key can be used?
3. Can you confirm whether the key is currently revoked or disabled?

If helpful, I can provide request timestamps or additional headers for debugging.

Thanks in advance for your help — please let me know any logs or details you need from my side.

Best regards,
<Your name>
